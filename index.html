									<h2>About me</h2>
								</header>
								<p>
									Creative and attentive E-business graduate (Cand.IT) from the IT University of Copenhagen. I have more than six years of successful experience in corporate finance, ERP and CRM systems.
									For the last four years I've worked as an IT Business Consultant, and I have gained extensive knowledge with both on-premise and cloud solutions within Business Management Software. Not only have I advised and guided customers, I have also acquired substantial knowledge in IT/database architecture.

									In extension of my work experience and my studies, I have developed a keen interest in computer science and software development, and I am determined on making a slight turn in my career path in order to gain even more knowledge within this field.
									I have completed several online certifications in iOS development and Python development, among others. I am strongly considering making
									Working with ERP has also made me cross ways with Salesforce. Working with the platform has shown me, why this system is the #1 CRM provider worldwide, and I have for the last year been on the Salesforce Developer trail - hopefully getting certified soon.
